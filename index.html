        FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (Features in scope for this release)

        - The selected day shall be clearly highlighted/visible
        - Show all the appointments for the day
        - Add some appointments for a specific day (date), at a specific time
            (appointments should be saved/stored for that day)
        - Appoinments shall have a description

        NICE TO HAVE FEATURES (Features out of scope for this release)
        Those are features that maybe we will build in the future

        - Book other peple/contacts in my appoinments
        - Add reminders
        - Actually show the days for the current month (e.g., 28 in we are in Feb, and not 31)
        - Notifications for events
        - Responsive design so that it works on mobile

        ----------------------------------------------------------------

        DESIGN PHASE (SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE DESIGN)
        We talk about software design, not about visual/UX design, for the scope of this document.

        Role: SOFTWARE ARCHITECT

        >>> HTML:
        -- Headings for the sections of the page: Calendar / Add Event
        -- ?? Divs for the sections of the page: Calendar / Add Event
        -- Container for the days (probably a div) - (we can think about using a table?)
        -- Div tags for each day (they will contain the day number)
        -- So: one div for the month, containing divs for each day
        -- Inputs: time for meeting time, text for meeting description, button to save
        -- A list for appointmens for the selected day

        >>> CSS:
        -- Class for the headings (caps lock, bold, green)
        -- The style of the body: black background, etc.
        -- .day class to apply a style to the day (e.g., border if selected, margin)
        -- a class / styles for input tags (green, etc.)
        -- .calendar -- class for the month, the container for the days
        -- .appointmens class to style appointments for the day
        (A good way to display a calendar like this could be a flexbox -- you will learn about it in next modules)

        >>> JS:
        -- Based on the month (actually, right now, always 31) -- display a div each day
        -- Day onclick -> select that day as current day, and it displays the appointments for the day
        -- Function to display all appointments programmatically: for each appointment, show a list item
        -- Button onclick -> take input time and description, and add an appointments to the selected day
        -- We need to store the data somewhere: many days, for each one we save zero or more appointments
